**ELEVEN - Elevator Brake Optimization and UQ** is an easy to run code for robust optimization and uncertainty quantification of an elevator brake system. The implementation follows an educational style, to make its use very intuitive.

## Software History

This code was developed to conduct numerical simulations related to the robust optimization and uncertainty quantification of an elevator brake system. The underlying results are reported in the following paper:
- *P. Wolszczak, P. Lonkwic, A. Cunha Jr, G. Litak, and S. Molski, Robust optimization and uncertainty quantification in the nonlinear mechanics of an elevator brake system, Meccanica, v. 54, pp. 1057-1069, 2019* https://doi.org/10.1007/s11012-019-00992-7

## Documentation

**ELEVEN** routines are commented in order to explain their functionality to the final user. Each routine has a short description about its purpose, and a list of inputs and/or outputs.
